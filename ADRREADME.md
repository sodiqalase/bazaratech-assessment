## ADR 2: State Management Strategy
**Date:** Current

### Context
The application needed a state management solution that's both powerful and simple to maintain.

### Decision
We chose Zustand for global state management, combined with React's built-in hooks for local state.

### Rationale
- Zustand provides a simpler alternative to Redux
- Built-in React hooks (useState, useContext) for component-level state
- Excellent TypeScript support and minimal boilerplate
- Small bundle size and great performance

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Reduced boilerplate compared to Redux
  - Better performance through optimized re-renders
  - Simplified state updates and debugging
- **Negative:**
  - Two different patterns for state management
  - Learning curve for developers new to either library

## ADR 3: Styling Solution
**Date:** Current

### Context
The project needed a styling solution that's maintainable, scalable, and developer-friendly.

### Decision
We chose TailwindCSS with SCSS support and additional utilities (clsx, tailwind-merge) for styling, along with Recharts for data visualization.

### Rationale
- TailwindCSS provides utility-first approach
- SCSS support for custom styling when needed
- clsx and tailwind-merge for conditional class merging
- Base UI Components for foundational UI elements
- Recharts for responsive and customizable charts
- Built-in responsive design utilities
- Strong community and documentation

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Faster development through utility classes
  - Consistent design system
  - Reduced CSS bundle size through PurgeCSS
  - Type-safe class merging with tailwind-merge
  - Reusable base components
- **Negative:**
  - Initial learning curve for Tailwind syntax
  - Longer class names in components
  - Need to manage multiple styling tools

## ADR 4: Testing Strategy
**Date:** Current

### Context
The project needed a robust testing strategy to ensure code quality and reliability.

### Decision
We chose Jest and React Testing Library for testing, with a focus on component and integration testing.

### Rationale
- Jest provides a comprehensive testing framework
- React Testing Library encourages testing user behavior
- Strong TypeScript support
- Active community and extensive documentation

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Improved code reliability
  - Better developer confidence in changes
  - Clear testing patterns
- **Negative:**
  - Additional development time for test writing
  - Learning curve for behavior-driven testing

## ADR 5: Form Management
**Date:** Current

### Context
The application needed a robust form management solution with validation capabilities.

### Decision
We chose Formik with Yup validation.

### Rationale
- Formik provides comprehensive form management
- Yup offers strong TypeScript integration for validation
- Reduced boilerplate compared to manual form handling
- Strong community support and documentation

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Simplified form state management
  - Type-safe form validation
  - Consistent form handling patterns
- **Negative:**
  - Additional bundle size
  - Learning curve for complex validation scenarios

## ADR 6: Component Architecture
**Date:** Current

### Context
The project needed a clear component architecture that promotes reusability and maintainability.

### Decision
We implemented a modular component architecture with atomic design principles.

### Rationale
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved component reusability
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Scalable structure for future additions

### Architecture Overview
```
components/
├── ui/          # Atomic components (buttons, inputs)
├── layout/      # Layout components
└── modules/     # Feature-specific components
```

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Better code organization
  - Improved component reusability
  - Easier maintenance
- **Negative:**
  - More initial setup time
  - Need for clear documentation

## ADR 7: API Integration Strategy
**Date:** Current

### Context
The application needed a reliable way to handle API interactions and data fetching.

### Decision
We chose native Fetch API with React Error Boundary for error handling.

### Rationale
- Built-in Fetch API for modern browsers
- React Error Boundary for graceful error handling
- Next.js optimizations for data fetching
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Reduced bundle size by avoiding external HTTP clients

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Zero additional dependencies for data fetching
  - Centralized error handling
  - Type-safe API calls
  - Better user experience with toast notifications
  - Smaller bundle size
- **Negative:**
  - Manual cache management needed
  - Need to handle loading states manually
  - Need to standardize error handling across fetch calls

## ADR 8: Development Tooling
**Date:** Current

### Context
The project needed a robust development environment with proper tooling for code quality and consistency.

### Decision
We implemented a comprehensive set of development tools including ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and TypeScript.

### Rationale
- ESLint with TypeScript for code quality
- Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Husky for Git hooks
- TypeScript for type safety
- Jest and Testing Library for testing
- SASS for advanced styling capabilities

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Consistent code style across the project
  - Caught errors before runtime
  - Automated code quality checks
  - Better developer experience
- **Negative:**
  - Initial setup complexity
  - Need to maintain multiple config files
  - Build time overhead

## Future Considerations

   - Evaluate solutions like next-intl or react-i18next

3. **Authentication Evolution**
   - Monitor authentication needs and potential improvements
   - Consider implementing more auth providers if needed

4. **State Management Scale**
   - Monitor Zustand's effectiveness as the application grows
   - Consider additional optimization strategies if needed

5. **UI Component Evolution**
