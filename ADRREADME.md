# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This document contains the architectural decisions made in the Bazara Assessment project. Each ADR provides context about key technical choices, their implications, and the reasoning behind them.

## ADR 1: Next.js 14 with App Router
**Date:** Current

### Context
The project needed a modern React framework that provides server-side rendering, routing, and optimal performance out of the box.

### Decision
We chose Next.js 14 with the App Router pattern over other alternatives like Remix or plain React.

### Rationale
- App Router provides more intuitive and flexible routing
- Built-in support for React Server Components
- Enhanced performance through automatic code splitting
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Simplified API routes with the new Route Handlers
- Better SEO capabilities through server-side rendering
- Active community and extensive documentation

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Improved performance through server-side rendering
  - Better SEO capabilities
  - Simplified deployment with Vercel integration
  - Type-safe routing
- **Negative:**
  - Learning curve for developers new to App Router
  - Some third-party libraries might need updates for compatibility

## ADR 2: State Management Strategy
**Date:** Current

### Context
The application needed a state management solution that's both powerful and simple to maintain.

### Decision
We implemented a hybrid approach using Zustand for global state and React Query for server state management.

### Rationale
- Zustand provides a simpler alternative to Redux
- React Query handles server state caching and synchronization
- This combination provides clear separation between client and server state

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Reduced boilerplate compared to Redux
  - Better performance through optimized re-renders
  - Simplified state updates and debugging
- **Negative:**
  - Two different patterns for state management
  - Learning curve for developers new to either library

## ADR 3: Styling Solution
**Date:** Current

### Context
The project needed a styling solution that's maintainable, scalable, and developer-friendly.

### Decision
We chose TailwindCSS with SCSS support for styling.

### Rationale
- TailwindCSS provides utility-first approach
- SCSS support for custom styling when needed
- Excellent developer experience with auto-completion
- Built-in responsive design utilities
- Strong community and documentation

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Faster development through utility classes
  - Consistent design system
  - Reduced CSS bundle size through PurgeCSS
- **Negative:**
  - Initial learning curve for Tailwind syntax
  - Longer class names in components

## ADR 4: Testing Strategy
**Date:** Current

### Context
The project needed a robust testing strategy to ensure code quality and reliability.

### Decision
We chose Jest and React Testing Library for testing, with a focus on component and integration testing.

### Rationale
- Jest provides a comprehensive testing framework
- React Testing Library encourages testing user behavior
- Strong TypeScript support
- Active community and extensive documentation

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Improved code reliability
  - Better developer confidence in changes
  - Clear testing patterns
- **Negative:**
  - Additional development time for test writing
  - Learning curve for behavior-driven testing

## ADR 5: Form Management
**Date:** Current

### Context
The application needed a robust form management solution with validation capabilities.

### Decision
We chose Formik with Yup validation.

### Rationale
- Formik provides comprehensive form management
- Yup offers strong TypeScript integration for validation
- Reduced boilerplate compared to manual form handling
- Strong community support and documentation

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Simplified form state management
  - Type-safe form validation
  - Consistent form handling patterns
- **Negative:**
  - Additional bundle size
  - Learning curve for complex validation scenarios

## ADR 6: Component Architecture
**Date:** Current

### Context
The project needed a clear component architecture that promotes reusability and maintainability.

### Decision
We implemented a modular component architecture with atomic design principles.

### Rationale
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved component reusability
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Scalable structure for future additions

### Architecture Overview
```
components/
├── ui/          # Atomic components (buttons, inputs)
├── layout/      # Layout components
└── modules/     # Feature-specific components
```

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Better code organization
  - Improved component reusability
  - Easier maintenance
- **Negative:**
  - More initial setup time
  - Need for clear documentation

## ADR 7: API Integration Strategy
**Date:** Current

### Context
The application needed a reliable way to handle API interactions and data fetching.

### Decision
We chose Axios with React Query for API integration.

### Rationale
- Axios provides consistent API across browsers
- React Query handles caching and state management
- Strong TypeScript support
- Simplified error handling

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Optimized data fetching
  - Automatic caching and background updates
  - Simplified error handling
- **Negative:**
  - Additional learning curve
  - Need to manage cache invalidation

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Consider implementing analytics and performance monitoring
   - Evaluate tools like Next.js Analytics or custom solutions

2. **Internationalization**
   - Plan for potential multi-language support
   - Evaluate solutions like next-intl or react-i18next

3. **Authentication Evolution**
   - Monitor authentication needs and potential improvements
   - Consider implementing more auth providers if needed

4. **State Management Scale**
   - Monitor Zustand's effectiveness as the application grows
   - Consider additional optimization strategies if needed
